"""API shapes for the accountability layer.

Like :mod:`app.model.reports`, these carry the published *names* alongside the
numbers -- "Very High", "Declined Significantly", "Yellow" -- so a client never
has to know that colour 3 means yellow or that status level 5 means the best
outcome for one indicator and the worst for another.

Every result says whether it was published by the state or projected by this
application.  That distinction is the most important thing on the page and is
never left for the client to infer.
