"""Reference (dimension) tables for the CAASPP and ELPAC reporting model.

Every table here mirrors a lookup that the California Assessment of Student
Performance and Progress (CAASPP) and English Language Proficiency Assessments
for California (ELPAC) reporting system publishes alongside its research files:

* :class:`Assessment` mirrors *Table C — Test IDs and Names*.
* :class:`StudentGroup` mirrors *Table A — Student Groups*.
* :class:`GradeLevel` mirrors *Table B — Grades*.
* :class:`Entity` mirrors the entities file that accompanies every research file.
* :class:`PerformanceLevelScheme` / :class:`PerformanceLevel` and
  :class:`SubscoreDefinition` capture the achievement-level and
  area/domain vocabulary that differs between tests, which the layouts express
  only in prose.

Reference rows are versioned by test year wherever the state has changed a
test.  The California Spanish Assessment, for example, reported three *score
ranges* and no domains through 2023-24 and three *performance levels* with four
domains and two composites from 2024-25 onward, so the level scheme and the
subscore vocabulary hang off :class:`AssessmentYear` rather than
:class:`Assessment`.
