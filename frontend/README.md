# California Dashboard front-end documentation

The test suite for React components using Storybook, Vitest, and Playwright.

- Experiment with components while previewing them with Storybook.
- A light-weight development environment without Docker.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

Before running anything, first create the required `.env` files.
See [environment variable documentation](https://opensacorg.github.io/app-capanel-doc/developer-guide/environment-variables).

- Node.js (v24 or later)
- Vite+
- Playwright (with browser installed)

### Start Storybook

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result. Storybook hosts the component
stories and all written documentation.

```sh
vp run storybook
```

### Start the website

The full website is included so you can run and experiment with it locally
on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```sh
vp dev
```

## Build for deployment

The front end is a static build deployed on its own, separately from the API.
`VITE_BASE_PATH` sets the path it is served from, and `VITE_API_URL` the public origin of the API. Both are read at
build time.

```sh
# Custom domain at the root, e.g. https://example.org/
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.org vp build

# GitHub Pages project site, e.g. https://opensacorg.github.io/app-capanel-web/
VITE_BASE_PATH=app-capanel-web VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.org vp build
```

Each build also writes `404.html` and `.nojekyll` into `dist/`, so GitHub Pages serves deep links through the
client-side router. Neither file affects any other host. See
the [environment variable documentation](https://opensacorg.github.io/app-capanel-doc/developer-guide/environment-variables)
for the full description of both variables.

## Test

This website primarily uses Storybook. It is also a home for a bigger test suite using Vitest and Playwright. For more
information see
the [testing guide](https://innovate-for-california-doc.vercel.app/?path=/docs/developer-guide--docs#install-pnpm).

> [!WARNING]
> Critical Playwright tests should also be included in the main website repository.

## VSCode support

> [!Note]
> PNPM commands must be run from the frontend folder. It is recommended to open the frontend folder directly in VSCode.
> To run from the root of the project, it is recommended to use Make.

This project comes with a .vscode/ folder to help get up and running with VSCode.

- Start debugging with F5. More run configurations can be found in [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json).
- View recommended project extensions by typing @recommended in the VSCode extension search.
