/**
 * The local half of the Dashboard, before the agency's own answers arrive.
 *
 * Lives beside {@link LocalMeasures} rather than with the accountability
 * placeholders so this component, and the route that owns it, stay in one
 * bundle: importing across that boundary pulled the accountability catalogue
 * snapshot into the shared chunk, where every page paid to parse it.
 *
 * The priority names are not known here, so these cards are unnamed — but
 * their count, their left border and their grid match the loaded ones, which
 * is what stops the page reflowing beneath them.
