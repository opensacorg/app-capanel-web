/**
 * What a long wait means, said while the reader is still waiting.
 *
 * A skeleton answers "something is coming". It does not answer "why is this
 * taking fifteen seconds", and a reader who is not told will assume the site
 * is broken rather than that it is reading a dataset for the first time.
 *
 * So the notice is graded with the wait. Under a few seconds it says nothing.
 * Past that it is a quiet line: the page is working. Past eight seconds it
 * becomes a real explanation, because at that point the reader has decided
 * something is wrong and needs telling otherwise.
 *
 * `aria-live='polite'` rather than an alert: this interrupts nothing, it just
 * needs to reach a reader who cannot see the skeletons move.
