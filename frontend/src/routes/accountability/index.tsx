/**
 * The accountability report — the layer caschooldashboard.org actually shows.
 *
 * Where /dashboard reports what students scored, this reports how the state
 * judged a school: one performance colour per indicator, the student groups
 * beneath it, and the history behind it.
 *
 * Five of the seven indicators here (chronic absenteeism, suspension,
 * graduation, college/career, English learner progress) have no assessment
 * source at all — they come from the state's own Dashboard files.
 *
 * The selection lives in the URL, so any view of this report is a link.
 *
 * On layout. The page is a header, a row of indicators, and one indicator
 * examined — read top to bottom, that is the order the question is actually
 * asked in. The entity, the year and the student group all sit in the header
 * rather than in a filter card, because they are what the heading means, not
 * a separate control panel. Choosing the entity itself has left the page
 * entirely: it lives in the navigation bar, where it is reachable from every
 * report rather than repeated on each one.
 *
 * On loading. The catalogue endpoint is slow and everything else on the page
 * used to wait behind it, so a cold visit spent a quarter of a minute looking
 * at three grey rectangles. Two things changed. The catalogue now arrives as
 * an assumption first (see `accountabilityShape`), which lets every other
 * request leave immediately and lets this page draw its real structure — its
 * indicator names, its filters, its tables, its prose — before a single figure
 * is known. And a wait long enough to look broken now says why it is long,
 * because the long case is a dataset being read for the first time, not a
 * fault. What is never assumed is a measured value: those stay skeletons.
